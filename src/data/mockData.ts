    question: 'A nurse is caring for a client who has pneumonia. Which of the following interventions should the nurse implement to promote airway clearance?',
    options: [
      'Encourage the client to lie flat in bed',
      'Provide chest physiotherapy every 2 hours',
      'Restrict fluid intake to prevent congestion',
      'Administer a cough suppressant as needed'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    rationale: {
      explanation: 'Chest physiotherapy helps mobilize secretions in clients with pneumonia by using percussion, vibration, and postural drainage techniques.',
      keyPoints: [
        'Chest physiotherapy mechanically loosens secretions',
        'Regular positioning changes promote drainage',
        'Adequate hydration thins secretions'
      ],
      commonMisconceptions: [
        'Lying flat can worsen pneumonia by promoting secretion pooling',
        'Fluid restriction actually thickens secretions',
        'Cough suppressants prevent beneficial expectoration'

    question: 'A client with diabetes mellitus type 1 is admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Which laboratory value would the nurse expect to find?',
    options: [
      'Blood glucose 250 mg/dL, pH 7.35',
      'Blood glucose 450 mg/dL, pH 7.25',
      'Blood glucose 180 mg/dL, pH 7.40',
      'Blood glucose 320 mg/dL, pH 7.45'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    rationale: {
      explanation: 'DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) and acidosis (pH <7.30) due to ketone production from fat breakdown.',
      keyPoints: [
        'DKA involves severe hyperglycemia',
        'Acidosis results from ketone accumulation',
        'pH below 7.30 indicates acidosis'
      ],
      commonMisconceptions: [
        'Normal glucose levels rule out DKA',
        'Alkalosis can occur in DKA',

    options: [
      'Rub hands for 10 seconds with alcohol-based sanitizer',
      'Wash hands for 20 seconds with soap and warm water',
      'Use hand sanitizer only when hands appear soiled',

      explanation: 'Proper handwashing requires 20 seconds with soap and warm water to effectively remove microorganisms and prevent healthcare-associated infections.',
      keyPoints: [
        '20 seconds is the minimum effective duration',
        'Soap mechanically removes pathogens',
        'Warm water enhances soap effectiveness'
      ],
      commonMisconceptions: [
        '10 seconds is insufficient for pathogen removal',
